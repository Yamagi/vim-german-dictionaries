# German dictionaries for Vim

This is an effort to create a reliable german dictionary for Vim and
compatible editors. It combines the well known *frami* word lists with
an affix file compatible with Vims MySpell / Hunspell dialect.

The word lists are taken from the LibreOffice dictionaries:
  * https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/german-de-at-frami-dictionaries
  * https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/german-de-de-frami-dictionaries
  * https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/german-de-ch-frami-dictionaries

The affix files are based upon earlier work by Github user @ganwell
and the Vim developers:
